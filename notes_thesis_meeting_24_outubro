GOALS:
Start to search and understand how would an EMS be implemntend in a Port 

How can an EMS be appplied to a port ?

Which APIs (External DATA) can we use for the EMS in question?
- Meteo
- Market Prices 
- Localization Boats in Port
- Incoming boats shedule ??
- More Boats data 

At the moment the data comes from 31 general (QUADROS)
Data that's gonna be available soon - Solar Production and Electric Mobility 

In the perspective of Dashboard, what are import indicators to monitored? 

Forecast goal: What to produce? What is going to be consumed ?  What each boat consumes (depending on type of boat) ?

Understanding EMS Implementation in Ports
Key frameworks to research:

ISO 14001 - The standard framework most ports use
PERS (Port Environmental Review System) - Specifically designed for ports by EcoPorts
ESPO Green Guide - European Sea Ports Organisation best practices
IMO/MARPOL regulations - International maritime environmental standards

Look into case studies from ports like Rotterdam, Hamburg, Barcelona, and Singapore - they have mature EMS systems you can learn from.
External APIs & Data Sources
For your specific needs:
Meteorological Data:

IPMA (Instituto PortuguÃªs do Mar e da Atmosfera) - national weather service
OpenWeatherMap API
Copernicus Marine Service - EU marine data

Vessel Tracking & Scheduling:

MarineTraffic API - real-time vessel positions, schedules, vessel characteristics
VesselFinder API - similar vessel tracking
AIS (Automatic Identification System) data streams
Port Authority's own systems (check what Funchal Port Authority/APRAM has)

Market Prices:

Energy prices: OMIE (Iberian electricity market)
Fuel prices: Platts, Argus Media APIs
Carbon pricing: EU ETS data

Vessel Consumption Data:

IMO's ship databases
Vessel type classification systems (can help estimate consumption patterns)

Critical Dashboard Indicators (KPIs)
Based on your goals, consider monitoring:
Environmental:

Energy consumption (kWh) - total & by source
CO2 emissions (direct + indirect)
Water consumption
Waste generated & recycled
Air quality (NOx, SOx, PM)
Noise levels

Operational:

Vessel calls by type (cruise, cargo, ferry, yacht)
Berth occupancy rates
Shore power connection rate
Turnaround times

Predictive/Forecast:

Expected energy demand (based on incoming vessels)
Solar production forecast vs. demand
Peak consumption periods
Vessel-specific consumption estimates

Your "31 Quadros" (Tables/Dashboards)
This existing data structure is valuable! You should:

Map what environmental aspects each quadro currently covers
Identify which align with ISO 14001 requirements
Find gaps in environmental monitoring
Plan how to integrate new data sources (solar, e-mobility)

Forecasting Framework
For your consumption prediction goals:

Build a vessel typology database (cruise ships, container vessels, tankers, etc.)
Estimate consumption by: vessel type + size + duration of stay + services used
Factor in: seasonal patterns, shore power availability, weather conditions
Use the incoming schedule to predict daily/weekly demand

Next Steps I'd Recommend:

Research existing port EMS implementations (focus on European ports similar to Funchal)
Interview Funchal Port Authority about current data collection methods
Map the 31 existing quadros to understand baseline data
Prototype a simple API integration (start with weather or vessel tracking)
Define priority KPIs with your team
