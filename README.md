# EMS_Port_Thesis


Motivation

Why we need energy managment systems in Ports? 
What are the problems we can fix with their implemtation?
What are the difference between a general EMS and one specific related with port and vessels
If i work in a port what are the concerns ? ( Maybe general )
What information do we need? is there any boat? what type of boat? Are we accounting for more boats?
What type of machines is used in a port? Do we need to keep in account~those ? 
Are we producing only for to feed vessels or we have a direct contact with the island grid ? 
What are usualy the type of vessels that the Port takes?
